# Elevate Engine - Real-Time Physics and Simulation Engine (C++)

Elevate Engine is a real-time physics and simulation engine written in C++. It is designed with a goal of being a game-ready, high-performance and physically accurate physics engine mirroring production-level systems. Having spent significant time refreshing and building a strong foundation in Newtonian Mechanics with Principles of Physics by Haliday and Resnick, along with The Feynman Lectures, Elevate Engine was built as a practical application of the elegant Newtonian theory which underpins our universe as well as the exciting and immersive real-time applications such as games which are at the forefront of technical achievements of the real-time interactive media industry.

## Overview

Elevate Engine provides a comprehensive suite of both foundational and advanced physics simulation features such as rigid body dynamics, collision detection and resolution, and constraints within an engine architecture with integrated user interface and tooling allowing for a wide range of customization.

Elevate is built with modularity and extensibility in mind, using a modern C++ approach which allows for easy integration of new forces types, collision shapes and scene objects. Elevate served as both a learning exercises, signifcantly deepening my understanding and intuition of the constraints, challenges and opportunities that exist within real-time physics simulations of games, while developing the underlying theoretical concepts.

Beyond foundational systems such as rigid body dynamics and collision detection, Elevate Engine also implements a number of advanced systems used directly in the AAA games of today such as vehicle physics (including car and aeroplane systems), ragdoll simulations and dynamic fracture destruction systems. Ian Millington#'s Game Physics Engine Development served as a key reference in the design and grounding of the project while opening up many opportunies for extension and enhancement.

## Project Goals

Not only did Elevate allow me to demonstrate and showcase my abilities in systems development, low-level programming and the integration of complex mathematics and physics theory, it was a core experience in enhancing my knowledge of real world engine and simulation considerations to further my qualities as a development in production level engines. 

The core goals of Elevate Engine were:

- Implement a robust, stable and efficient real-time physics engine in C++ utilising modern programming practices and a low-level graphics API in OpenGL 4.6
- Gain a deeper understanding of Newtonian Mechanics and the principles of physics that underpin real-time simulations
- Further my intuition of these core Newtonian principles and real world constraints through practical, production-level implementation and integration of a wide-range of complex systems
- Develop a modular and extensible architecture that allows for easy addition of new features, forces and object types
- Create a suite of tools and debugging visualizations to aid in development and testing of physics simulations
